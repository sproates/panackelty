## Deliver developer preview `0.1.0-alpha.1` — delivered

<a id="rm-79"></a>

**RM#79: Initial developer preview**.

The delivered initial product goal was a public developer preview that lets a new user
download Panackelty, put `panack` on `PATH`, and check, compile, and run a source
file using the downloaded toolchain. The preview is
an explicitly experimental release rather than a claim of language or bytecode
stability.

The initial target matrix is Linux x86-64 and macOS arm64. Each target remains
in the matrix only if its final downloadable artifact can be built and exercised
on that platform in release automation. Windows, additional architectures, and
package-manager distribution must not delay the preview.

### 1. Freeze the preview contract

- [x] Declare the release version `0.1.0-alpha.1` and document what the `alpha`
      stability level promises for source syntax, standard-library APIs, CLI
      behavior, and bytecode compatibility
- [x] Record Linux x86-64 and macOS arm64 as the initial supported targets,
      including the oldest tested operating-system versions and the policy for
      best-effort behavior elsewhere
- [x] Publish the deliberately postponed language features and known test or
      implementation limitations as preview limitations rather than implicit
      promises
- [x] Freeze unrelated language feature work until the preview release gates
      below are satisfied

### 2. Establish the public project boundary

- [x] Choose and add the source and binary distribution license
- [x] Confirm that the project name, documentation, examples, and supplied
      photograph may be published under the chosen terms
- [x] Add concise security reporting, contribution, support, and release-notes
      documents appropriate to an experimental compiler and native runtime
- [x] Audit the publishable tree for secrets, personal data, local configuration,
      generated output, accidental binaries, and material that should remain
      private
- [x] Ensure the license, release notes, and required notices are present in
      both the source repository and every binary archive

### 3. Version the complete toolchain

- [x] Define one canonical source of the Panackelty release version
- [x] Add `panack --version` with focused and public-CLI tests, reporting the
      release version, bytecode version, and enough build provenance to identify
      a published artifact
- [x] Keep version injection deterministic so the stage-2/stage-3 fixed-point
      proof and reproducible package build remain meaningful
- [x] Name artifacts with release, operating system, and architecture, for
      example `panackelty-0.1.0-alpha.1-macos-arm64.tar.gz`

### 4. Produce download-and-run archives

- [x] Make the installed toolchain self-contained, including the launcher,
      native VM, compiler bytecode, standard-library modules, and resource
      discovery outside a source checkout
- [x] Replace the archive's installation-shaped `usr/local` root with a friendly,
      relocatable top-level `panackelty/` directory containing `bin`, `libexec`,
      `share`, documentation, and license files
- [x] Build an archive independently for every supported target containing only
      the runtime toolchain and user-facing files
- [x] Verify that moving the extracted directory does not break compiler or
      standard-library discovery
- [x] Publish SHA-256 checksums and build provenance beside every archive

### 5. Add exact-artifact release gates

- [x] Add a release smoke test that starts from the final archive rather than
      the source or staging installation tree
- [x] On every supported target, unpack the archive into a fresh directory with
      only runtime tools available and no repository checkout
- [x] Require the unpacked toolchain to report its version and help, check a
      source file, compile it, run source and bytecode, pass program arguments,
      import the bundled standard library, and reject malformed bytecode
- [x] Require `make check`, the fixed-point bootstrap proof, native conformance,
      and the exact-artifact smoke test before a release tag can publish assets
- [x] Make the tag-driven release workflow upload only artifacts and checksums
      produced by successful matrix jobs

### 6. Make the first-user workflow usable

- [x] Put a download-and-run quick start before build-from-source instructions
      in `README.md`, covering archive selection, extraction, `PATH`, the first
      program, checking, compilation, execution, upgrade, and removal
- [x] Add a compact language tour that links each preview feature to a runnable
      example and its relevant specification section
- [x] Add at least a primary `file:line:column` location to lexer, parser, name,
      and type diagnostics so a new user can find the reported error; richer
      recovery across errors, stable codes, and automated fixes may
      follow the preview
- [x] Test the published quick start literally in a clean shell and require its
      stated output to match
- [x] Give preview users a clear place and template for actionable bug reports,
      including `panack --version`, host platform, source input, and output

### 7. Publish and verify

- [x] Export the reviewed working tree into a new isolated repository without
      the current `.git` directory, branches, tags, reflogs, remotes, or other
      local history; keep this working repository and its history intact
- [x] Configure publication identity and authenticate the separate personal
      GitHub account only in that isolated repository, without changing global
      Git configuration, the current GitHub login, or files under `~/.ssh`
- [x] Create and inspect one clean initial commit, publish the repository, then
      clone it into a fresh directory and run the documented contributor checks
      plus `make package`
- [x] Publish the annotated `0.1.0-alpha.1` tag and release only after its platform
      matrix and exact-archive gates pass
- [x] Download each public release asset by its published URL, verify its
      checksum, repeat the quick start, and record the evidence in the release
      notes

The developer preview is delivered only when an unaffiliated user can follow
the public quick start on a supported machine and reach this workflow using only
the downloaded archive:

```sh
panack --version
panack check hello.panack
panack compile hello.panack
panack run hello.bc
```

The preview does not require Windows support, a single-file executable,
package-manager installation, generic functions,
new automation APIs, complete diagnostic rendering, or a backwards-compatibility
guarantee. Those remain independent follow-up initiatives.
