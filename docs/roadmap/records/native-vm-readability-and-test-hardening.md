## Native VM readability and test hardening

<a id="rm-63"></a>

**RM#63: Native VM hardening**.

- [x] Decompose native decoding, verification, values, arithmetic, execution,
      builtins and host services into separately compiled modules.
- [x] Put shared declarations in self-contained headers, retain private local
      types, name wire opcodes, and document ownership and formatting conventions.
- [x] Add direct module ownership, cleanup, builtin registry and header checks,
      deterministic decoder mutations, and an isolated sanitizer target.
- [x] Sweep allocation failures across representative decoding, values, frames,
      exact arithmetic, nested execution and host operations; assert cleanup.
- [x] Add rich deterministic bytecode mutations, persistent ownership sequences,
      numeric boundary properties and selected host syscall failures.
- [x] Run native sanitizers in CI and publish LLVM line/branch coverage reports.
- [ ] Extend coverage-guided decoder fuzzing, host syscall/errno combinations,
      rendering and nested-execution branch coverage, and longer ownership runs;
      retain exact arithmetic, purity and runtime trap conformance throughout.

Manual release initiation retains the full validation gates. Keep its metadata
controls in the existing harness and its historical timing output for profile
comparability. GI#106 reassesses the active build/validation requirements; do not
weaken release tests as a shortcut.
